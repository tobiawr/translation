    "kb.bible-questions.baptism": {
        "infant-baptism": "Baby/Infant Baptism",
        "infant-baptism.content": "No one should be baptized unless they (1) know the truth of God (Matthew 28:19, 20), (2) believe it (Mark 16:16), (3) have repented (Acts 2:38), and (4) has experienced conversion (Acts 3:19). No baby could possibly qualify here. No one has a right to baptize a baby. To do so disregards God's direct commands regarding baptism. Years ago, misguided men in the church decreed that unbaptized babies were lost. This is biblically untrue. It slanders God as an unjust tyrant who would destroy innocent infants simply because their parents failed to have baptism administered. Such teaching is tragic. \n\nEphesians 4:5 says, \"One Lord, one faith, one baptism.\" There is only one true baptism. All other so-called baptisms are counterfeits. The word \"baptism\" comes from the Greek word \"baptisma.\" It means \"to dip under or submerge or immerse.\" There are eight Greek words in the New Testament used to describe the application of liquids. But among these various words—meaning to sprinkle, pour, or immerse—only the one meaning \"to immerse\" (baptizo) is used to describe baptism. \n\nLet's take the example of Jesus in Mark 1:9, 10. He was baptized by immersion. Notice that after the ordinance, He came \"up from the water.\" Jesus was baptized \"in the Jordan,\" not on the bank, as many believe. John the Baptist always found a place to baptize where \"there was much water\" (John 3:23), so it would be deep enough. First Peter 2:21 says we are called to follow Jesus' example.",
        "rebaptism": "Rebaptism",
        "rebaptism.content": "The personal witness of a changed life is an important aspect of being baptized. Rebaptism should be done when: \n\n1. A person receives more light - When Paul was preaching in Ephesus, he found 12 men who had been baptized by John the Baptist, but who had never heard of the Holy Spirit. So, upon receiving this new light, they were rebaptized (Acts 19:2-5). \n\n2. A person backslides then comes back to the Lord - When a person abandons his Christian experience then repents and comes back to the Lord, he should be rebaptized to start a new life with the Lord (Acts 2:38; Acts 19:4). \n\n3. A person was baptized in a non-biblical method - Baptism by immersion is the only biblical method of baptism that adequately illustrates what baptism symbolizes: believers dying, being buried with Christ, and being raised to newness of life (Romans 6:3-4). If the method of baptism was sprinkling or pouring, then it does not match the definition of baptism for the word baptize means \"to submerge in water.\" \n\n4. A person was baptized as an infant - An infant can't mentally learn of God's plan of salvation, believe in the Lord as a personal Savior, or repent for his sins. Thus, rebaptism for an adult is necessary. \n\nIs the Holy Spirit appealing to your heart this very moment? You love the Lord and recognize that He died for you. By faith, you've accepted His atoning death. Jesus' transforming grace brought peace and assurance into your life for the first time. If all these are true, make the most important decision in your life. The Spirit inquires, \"Why tarriest thou? Arise, and be baptized.\"",
        "purpose-of-baptism": "Purpose of Baptism",
        "purpose-of-baptism.content": "The Lord defined the terms for entrance into His Kingdom. \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God\" (John 3:5). His words are too clear to be misunderstood—that there are two absolute requirements for entrance into heaven. Every one of us must pass through these two experiences to be saved. \n\nIn John 3:3, Christ described the spiritual birth simply: \"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\" So to be \"born of the Spirit\" clearly refers to conversion. Then Jesus continued in verses 7 and 8 to describe the mysterious, silent work of the Spirit in its transforming mission. \n\nOn the other hand, being born of water refers to baptism. These two things are often closely tied together in the Scriptures. Conversion is the powerful inward change, and baptism is the outward physical sign that the change has taken place. Notice how Christ repeated the two conditions for salvation on another occasion, \"He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned\" (Mark 16:16). How could it be made any plainer?"

Also, no spiritual gift is limited to men in the lists in the New Testament (1 Corinthians 12: 27-31; Romans 12: 3-8; 1 Peter 4: 8-11). Women were commanded to build the body of Christ, which included teaching (Titus 2: 4) and prophecy (Acts 2:17, 18; 21: 9; 1 Corinthians 11: 5). \n\nYet just because 1 Timothy 2:12 explicitly teaches that a woman is not to teach a man, women are nevertheless free to teach in many other ways. In fact, women are commanded to explain the gospel to everyone, including lost men (cf. Acts 18:26). Within the church, women may teach women and children. With men in the church, women should discuss spiritual matters in an informing (not authoritative) way. This does not mean that a man cannot learn from a woman's conduct or from a conversation with a woman and apply what he learns to his life."

The comma in Luke 23:43 would be better placed after the word “today” rather than before, so that the passage reads, “Assuredly, I say to you today, you will be with Me in Paradise.” Another way to put this verse that makes sense in the immediate context is: “I’m telling you today—when it seems that I can save no one when I Myself am being crucified as a criminal—I give you the assurance today that you will be with me in Paradise.” Christ’s kingdom of glory will be set up at His second coming (Matthew 25:31), and the righteous of all ages will enter it at that time (1 Thessalonians 4:15–17) and not at death.",

Jesus, referring to the same type of scenario, said, \"From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation\" (Luke 11:51). This personification is used in Genesis when God said to Cain, \"What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother crieth out to me from the ground\" (Gen 4:10). These souls are told to \"rest\" until others should be killed (Rev 6:11). This 'rest' applies to those who are dead. They are said to be witnesses to God's word and white robes were given them. \n\nObviously, this is a language that applies to those who are saved, not those who are lost.

Bible prophecy affirms that God knows the future, but future events do not happen because God “foreknew” them. They are known by God because they will take place. \n\nMoreover, because God knows something will happen does not mean He wills it to happen. \n\nDid God predestinate that only some would be saved? Paul writes elsewhere that God “desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth” (1 Tim. 2:4). If only some are predestined to be saved, why would Jesus offer salvation to all? Christ said, “Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely” (Rev. 22:17). \n\nThe Contemporary English Version Bible translates Romans 8:29 more precisely, stating that God “has always known who His chosen ones would be. He had decided to let them become like His own Son so that His Son would be the first of many children.” While everyone is called to salvation, not everyone responds. But to those who choose to come to Christ, these are transformed into His likeness. \n\nGod has an all-knowing perspective, knowing whether you are going to be saved or lost. But this knowledge does not take away your free choice. Many Scripture passages demonstrate our freedom to choose. Joshua told Israel to “choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve” (Joshua 24:15). The story of the fall of humanity shows the high value (and high price) that God gave to Adam and Eve when He let them choose whether to obey or disobey Him."

There is perhaps one expression that gives some guidance: that is in the apostle Paul's letter to the church at Cor­inth. In 1 Corinthians 11:25, 26 he counsels: \"This do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remem­brance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till He come.\" \n\nAs far as we know, there is no counsel in the Spirit of prophecy on this matter. As an organi­zation, it seems that from the very beginning we have followed the plan of quarterly celebration of the ordinances, and this plan has persisted, in general at least, to the present time. \n\nDoubtless, in adopting the quarterly plan, the early Advent believers felt that in holding the service more frequently there would be the danger of formality and failure to realize the solemnity of the service. It seems it might have been a decision to keep in the middle of the road—from celebrating it too often, or leaving it for too long a period, such as a year. \n\nSo, to any question on the matter, we would say that the celebration of these ordinances is based upon definite Biblical evidence and coun­sel, but the time when these ordinances are celebrated is determined by the custom of the church."

We were redeemed and saved once for all by Christ with eternal results. In the same way, the lost will not be passing through the process of punishment forever but will be punished once and for all with eternal results.

Turn, turn from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Israel?'\" God is calling you, not out of fear of hell, but out of love. He is pleading with you to get rid of every sin in your life so someday you can enjoy an everlasting heavenly home where no pain or suffering exists. Why not listen to a fair, compassionate God who loves you and doesn't want anyone to suffer, but come unto Him. \n\nConsider the following story. Imagine God as a loving, compassionate surgeon. He loves each patient that comes into His office but hates the disease that attacks them. Each day He lovingly treats each case. One day you come into God's office with a case of gangrene. He loves you so much but says He must make an amputation to save your life because of the spreading nature of the disease.

In 1 Corinthians 14, Paul continues the discussion of spiritual gifts by focusing on speaking in tongues versus prophecy.

Isaiah 58:13-14 also says that this special day is holy; we shouldn't talk idly. Though it's not for our own fun, pleasure, or desire, it is an enjoyable and delightful day as we honor the Lord in what we do. \n\nIt's designed to be a day for public worship or 'sacred assembly' (Leviticus 23:3). \n\nJesus also suggested that the Sabbath hours be used for doing good deeds (Matthew 12:11-12). On the Sabbath, you can feel free to stop—guilt-free!—our regular daily activities, such as work and shopping, and, instead, spend time with the Creator of the universe. Worshipping God with other believers, spending time with family, walking in nature, reading spiritually uplifting materials, and even visiting and encouraging the sick are all good ways to keep the Sabbath holy. After the stress of six days of work, God has given us the gift of the Sabbath to rest from our labors and to feed our souls. We can trust that He knows what’s best for us!",

Our Savior invites us to go to Him, taking His yoke and learning from Him (Matthew 11:28-30). Jesus is our ultimate example, and as Christians, we ought to follow His example (1 Peter 2:21). When He walked here on earth, it's His custom to keep the seventh-day Sabbath (Luke 4:16). He even emphasized that 'The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath' (Mark 2:27). It means that He gave the Sabbath as a gift to us. He also said in John 14:15 that if we love Him, we will keep His commandments. Naturally, the people who love Him would want to keep His Sabbath commandment. Indeed, love without commandment-keeping is really not love at all (1 John 2:4). It's a decision we all must make, and we cannot avoid it. The good news is that choosing to keep the Sabbath will bless you profoundly! Daily, we should worship God. But there's a day that God set apart for holy use; on the seventh day, He specifically rested, blessing and sanctifying it (Genesis 2:2-3). In His 10 commandments, He highlighted that we should 'remember' the Sabbath day and keep it holy...the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord (Exodus 20:8-10). \n\nMoreover, Sabbath will be observed in the new earth (Isaiah 66:22, 23). Sabbath-keeping glorifies the Father. He said, \"My covenant I will not break, nor alter the word that has gone out of My lips\" (Psalm 89:34).",

Scripture- Luke 23:53-56, 24:1 shows the week's chronology and how the Sabbath day and the first day of the week relate to each other. Jesus died on the preparation day (we now call Good Friday). The next day, Sabbath, the women rested according to the commandment. And after the Sabbath, on the first day of the week, Jesus was resurrected. Thus, according to the Bible, the Sabbath day is the day before the first day of the week; we call it Saturday. \n\n2. The original calendars- Virtually, all old calendars started the week with Sunday. In fact, the Roman Catholic Church, which is over a thousand years, still refers to Sunday as the 1st day of the week. \n\n3. World languages- Looking at over 100 languages around the world, the 7th day of the week is translated as “Sabbath”. Example- Arabic: Sabet, Bosnian/Croatian/Czech: Sobota, Indonesian: Sabtu, Italian: Sabato, Latin: Sabbatum, Russian: Subbota, Galician/Filipino/Spanish: Sabado. \n\nAlso, in Scripture, “paraskeue\" (Gk) was used for preparation day. Even today, thousand years later, the 6th day of the week (\"Friday\" in the English calendar), is still called “Paraskeue\" in the modern Greek calendar. Thus, the day that comes after Friday is the Sabbath day. \n\n4. Modern Israel- There isn’t any historical record of any dispute among any Jewish groups that the day we call Saturday is the 7th day of the weekly cycle. They've successfully kept the original seven-day weekly cycle intact. The Jewish Sabbath (Shabbath, Shabbes, Shobos, etc.) is a weekly day of rest, observed from sundown on Friday until sundown on Saturday night.",

And He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross. Having disarmed principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in it. So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ.” \n\nIt's the law of ceremonies pointing to Jesus (the Lamb of God, who was sacrificed on the cross for our sins) that's nailed to the cross. At the cross, type (the Passover lamb) met antitype (Jesus, the Lamb of God). The symbol faced reality, shadow found its substance. Paul sums up the meaning of all Jewish ceremonials as \"a shadow of things to come.” So the sabbaths in Colossians 2:16 are those that were symbols of something better to come. In ancient Israel, there are 7 yearly ceremonial sabbaths that had to do with the annual Jewish feasts. These sabbaths came on different days of the week, through the years, just as your birthday does. \n\nThe seventh-day Sabbath of the 4th commandment is not a shadow waiting for its fulfilment. It's not symbolic of anything connected with the cross. It's the memorial of a completed fact—our world's creation in six days. It had no connection with the ceremonial sab­baths of Colossians 2:16 that were nailed to the cross. But the 7th-day Sabbath, as a part of God's eternal law, is never-ending and will continue to be kept in the new earth when sin is forever gone (Isaiah 66:23). \n",

That day was the Preparation, and the Sabbath drew near. And the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed after, and they observed the tomb and how His body was laid. Then they returned and prepared spices and fragrant oils. And they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment. Now on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they, and certain other women with them, came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared.” \n\nThis Scripture shows the chronology of the week including how the Sabbath day and the first day of the week relate to each other. According to Luke 23:54, Jesus died on the preparation day which we now call Good Friday. The next day, Sabbath, the women rested according to the commandment. Finally, after the Sabbath, on the first day of the week, Jesus was resurrected. \n\nTherefore, according to the Holy Book, the Sabbath day can be pinpointed as the day before the first day of the week.

God predicted it would happen (Daniel 7:25; Matthew 15:6, 9; Ezekiel 22:26, 28), and it did. \n\nOn March 7, A.D. 321, Constantine the Great issued the first civil Sunday law, compelling all the people in the Roman Empire, except farmers, to rest on Sunday. This, with five other civil laws decreed by Constantine concerning Sunday, set the legal precedent for all civil Sunday legislation from that time to the present. \n\nIn the 4th century, the Council of Laodicea urged Christians to honor Sunday by abstaining from work on that day if at all possible and prohibited them from abstaining from work on the Sabbath. \n\nThis error was passed on to our unsuspecting generation as fact. However, Sunday-keeping is a tradition of mere men and breaks God’s law, which commands Sabbath-keeping. Only God can make a day holy.

But nowhere in Scriptures did it suggest keeping Sunday holy in honor of the resurrection or for any other reason. We honor Christ by obeying His direct commandments (John 14:15)—not by substituting man-made traditions in place of His eternal law. Romans 6:3-6 answers how we should honor Jesus' resurrection, and that is through baptism."

The Scriptures declare: “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh” (Gen 2:24). Throughout Scripture, this heterosexual pattern is affirmed. The Bible makes no accommodation for homosexual activity or relationships. Sexual acts outside the circle of a heterosexual marriage are forbidden (Lev 18:5-23, 26; Lev 20:7-21; Rom 1:24-27; 1 Cor 6:9-11). Jesus reaffirmed the divine creation intent: “‘Haven’t you read...that at the beginning the Creator “made them male and female...” (Matt 19:5).

In Job 11:7-8, Zophar uttered the cry of each human heart- “Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?” \n\nThe study of God is without rival—the highest subject any mortal can ever even attempt to approach or contemplate. Because God defines Himself as everlasting and the ultimate power, presence, and knowledge, this field of study is deeper, wider, and broader than any other. \n\n“For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts” (Isaiah 55:9). Finite human minds will never be able to fully understand everything about the eternal God, any more than we can jump to the stars with our feeble legs. We need to approach this mystery shrouding His person with a large measure of barefoot reverence and deep humility. Like Moses, when he came into God’s presence, we must take off our shoes, “for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground” (Exodus 3:5). \n\n“If the Bible teaches that there's only one God, then how can God be composed of three persons?” Scripture unequivocally declares that there's only one God. Probably the most widely held Christian view of God is the “trinity.” The Godhead contains three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

The triune God can also be found in the gospel itself. In essence, we read that God the Father so loved the world that He sent God the Son that we might be born of God the Spirit (John 3:8, 13, 16, 17). The apostle Paul wrote that there were three divine persons: “There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; One Lord, one faith, one baptism, One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all” (Ephesians 4:4–6). \n\nPaul frequently referred to the three separate persons of the Godhead. See for example 2 Corinthians 13:14 and Hebrews 9:14. \n\nRevelation opens by introducing the three persons of the Godhead (Revelation 1:4–6 NKJV). In addition, we clearly see three distinct persons at the baptism of Jesus (Matthew 3:16-7). \n\nIf Jesus is the only person in the Godhead, where did the voice come from that declared, “This is my beloved Son”? Did He trisect Himself into a voice from heaven, the dove wafting down through the sky, and His body on the bank of the river? No. This was not simply a clever act of holy smoke and mirrors, but rather a regal reunion revealing the truth of the trinity. And on top of this, it is through the shared authority of these three persons that we are commissioned to baptize. “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost” (Matthew 28:19).",

Depending on the Scripture, “one” can often mean unity. \n\nWe see this principle established very early in Scripture. “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh” (Genesis 2:24). “One flesh” here does not mean that a married couple melts into one human after their wedding, rather they are to be united into one family. Jesus prayed that the apostles would be one, saying, “And the glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one: I in them, and You in Me; that they may be made perfect in one” (John 17:22, 23). \n\nWe need to keep in mind that when Moses said, “The Lord is one,” Israel was surrounded by polytheistic nations that worshiped many gods that were constantly involved in petty bickering and rivalry (Deuteronomy 6:4), whereas the God who created is composed of three separate beings who are perfectly united in their mission of saving and sustaining their creatures. As the Spirit is executing the will of both the Father and Son, it is His will also. \n\n“For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one” (1 John 5:7). Granted, it is a brain exercise to grasp that one God (“He”) is also, and equally, “They.” Like one rope with three united strands, the three persons of the Father, Son, and Spirit make up the one God.",

The truth that God is a “tri-unity” of two invisible persons (Father and Spirit) and one visible person (Jesus) is evident even in creation. \n\nThe universe- composed of space, matter (visible), time \n\nSpace- requires length, height, width \n\nTime- a tri-unity of past, present(visible), future \n\nMan- has physical (visible), mental, spiritual components \n\nCells- consist of 3 primary parts: outer wall, cytoplasm, nucleus (like the shell, white and yolk of an egg) \n\nLight- constitutes 3 primary rays or groups of wavelengths (Each ray has its own separate function. The first originates, the second illuminates, and the third consummates. The first ray, often called invisible light, is neither seen nor felt. The second is both seen and felt. The third is not seen but is felt as heat.) \n\nIn these examples, each is separate and distinct in itself. The removal of any one component results in the demise of the whole. In like manner, the Godhead contains 3 distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Each is God (Eph 4:6; Titus 2:13; Acts 5:3-4), yet there is one God. \n\nEven the sanctuary had 3 places: the Courtyard, the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place. There are 3 stages of salvation: justification, sanctification and glorification.

In Isaiah, the Redeemer, which is Jesus Christ in the New Testament (Gal 4:4-5), declares the “Lord God and His Spirit” are responsible for sending Him on His mission of redemption (Is 48:16-17 NKJV). The names for God found in Genesis and elsewhere tell us volumes about our Creator. “And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness” (Gen 1:26). The Hebrew word here for God is Elohim. It's a plural noun that's used more than 2,700x in the Old Testament. This means that inspired authors preferred to use Elohim about 10x more than the singular form “El” when they described God. In Daniel 7:13, we see a picture of the Father and the Son as two separate persons. “I was watching in the night visions, And behold, One like the Son of Man, Coming with the clouds of heaven!

These beliefs, as set forth here, constitute the church’s understanding and expression of the teaching of Scripture. \n\nRevision of these statements may be expected at a quinquennial General Conference Session whenever the church is led by the Holy Spirit to a fuller understanding of Bible truth, or if better language is found to express these teachings of God’s Holy Word. \n\nThe expression of these concepts helps provide an overall picture of what this Christian denomination collectively believes and practices. Together, these teachings reveal a God who is the architect of the world. In wisdom, grace and infinite love, He is actively working to restore a relationship with humanity that will last for eternity. \n\nThe 28 Fundamental Beliefs can be organized into six categories of doctrine: God, man, salvation, the church, daily Christian life, and last-day events (restoration).",

Mutual love, honor, respect, and responsibility are the fabric of this relationship, which is to reflect the love, sanctity, closeness, and permanence of the relationship between Christ and His church. \n\nRegarding divorce, Jesus taught that the person who divorces a spouse, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery. Although some family relationships may fall short of the ideal, a man and a woman who fully commit themselves to each other in Christ through marriage may achieve loving unity through the guidance of the Spirit and the nurture of the church. \n\nGod blesses the family and intends that its members shall assist each other toward complete maturity. Increasing family closeness is one of the earmarks of the final gospel message. \n\nParents are to bring up their children to love and obey the Lord. By their example and their words they are to teach them that Christ is a loving, tender, and caring guide who wants them to become members of His body, the family of God which embraces both single and married persons. \n\n(Please see Gen. 2:18-25; Exod. 20:12; Deut. 6:5-9; Prov. 22:6; Mal. 4:5, 6; Matt. 5:31, 32; 19:3-9, 12; Mark 10:11, 12; John 2:1-11; 1 Cor. 7:7, 10, 11; 2 Cor. 6:14; Eph. 5:21-33; 6:1-4.)",

        "24-christ's-ministry-in-the-heavenly-sanctuary.content": "There is a sanctuary in heaven, the true tabernacle that God set up, not humans. In it, Christ ministers on our behalf, making available to believers the benefits of His atoning sacrifice offered once for all on the cross. \n\nAt His ascension, He was inaugurated as our great High Priest and began His intercessory ministry, typified by the high priest's work in the holy place of the earthly sanctuary. \n\nIn 1844, at the end of the prophetic period of 2300 days, He entered the second and last phase of His atoning ministry, typified by the high priest's work in the most holy place. \n\nIt's a work of investigative judgment, typified by the sanctuary cleansing on the Day of Atonement. It reveals to heavenly intelligences who among the dead are asleep in Christ and therefore, in Him, are deemed worthy to have a part in the first resurrection. \n\nIt also makes manifest who among the living are abiding in Christ, keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, and in Him, therefore, are ready for translation into His everlasting kingdom. \n\nThis judgment vindicates the justice of God in saving those who believe in Jesus. It declares that those who have remained loyal to God shall receive the kingdom. The completion of this ministry of Christ will mark the close of human probation before the Second Advent. \n\n(Please see Lev. 16; Num. 14:34; Ezek. 4:6; Dan. 7:9-27; 8:13, 14; 9:24-27; Heb. 1:3; 2:16, 17; 4:14-16; 8:1-5; 9:11- 28; 10:19-22; Rev. 8:3-5; 11:19; 14:6, 7; 20:12; 14:12; 22:11, 12.)",

        "25-the-second-coming-of-christ.content": "The second coming of Christ is the blessed hope of the church, the grand climax of the gospel. \n\nThe Saviour’s coming will be literal, personal, visible, and worldwide. When He returns, the righteous dead will be resurrected, and together with the righteous living will be glorified and taken to heaven, but the unrighteous will die. \n\nThe almost complete fulfillment of most lines of prophecy, together with the present condition of the world, indicates that Christ’s coming is near. The time of that event has not been revealed, and we are therefore exhorted to be ready at all times. \n\n(Please see Matt. 24; Mark 13; Luke 21; John 14:1-3; Acts 1:9-11; 1 Cor. 15:51-54; 1 Thess. 4:13-18; 5:1-6; 2 Thess. 1:7- 10; 2:8; 2 Tim. 3:1-5; Titus 2:13; Heb. 9:28; Rev. 1:7; 14:14-20; 19:11-21.)",

But God, who alone is immortal, will grant eternal life to His redeemed. \n\nUntil that day death is an unconscious state for all people. When Christ, who is our life, appears, the resurrected righteous and the living righteous will be glorified and caught up to meet their Lord. \n\nThe second resurrection, the resurrection of the unrighteous, will take place a thousand years later. \n\n(Please see Job 19:25-27; Ps. 146:3, 4; Eccl. 9:5, 6, 10; Dan. 12:2, 13; Isa. 25:8; John 5:28, 29; 11:11-14; Rom. 6:23; 16; 1 Cor. 15:51-54; Col. 3:4; 1 Thess. 4:13-17; 1 Tim. 6:15; Rev. 20:1-10.)",

The unrighteous dead will then be resurrected, and with Satan and his angels will surround the city, but fire from God will consume them and cleanse the earth. \n\nThe universe will thus be freed of sin and sinners forever. \n\n(Please see Jer. 4:23-26; Ezek. 28:18, 19; Mal. 4:1; 1 Cor. 6:2, 3; Rev. 20; 21:1-5.)",

For here God Himself will dwell with His people, and suffering and death will have passed away. \n\nThe great controversy will be ended, and sin will be no more. All things, animate and inanimate, will declare that God is love; and He shall reign forever. Amen. \n\n(Please see Isa. 35; 65:17-25; Matt. 5:5; 2 Peter 3:13; Rev. 11:15; 21:1-7; 22:1-5.)"
